# covid-scrapers

**Help Needed:** We need help writing scrapers for individual state data.  You
don't have to use Haskell.  Any language will do.  To get started, [look at
the list of state data
sources](https://github.com/covid-db/covid-db/blob/master/state-sources.md).
Pick one that interests you, figure out where the data is, and start coding!
